                I would like to visit Cape Town because it is one of the few places that shaped South African streetwear
                that I haven't been to.
                I would like to visit the home to one of my favourite local clothing brands and get myself a few items
                and
                also get a feel of the city's streetwear culture.

                I would also like to visit Robben Island that is home to the prison where Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his
                27
                years, along with many
                other political prisoners in their fight to end Apartheid in South Africa.

                <img src="Mapungubwe.jpg" width="150" style="float: right; padding:10px">

                Mapungubwe means "Hill of the Jackals" and it was the first state in the whole of Southern Africa,
                this
                is after Mapungubwe had discovered itself as a kingdom.
                The civilization that was taking place in the area, the opportunities, the rule of law, the
                bureaucracy
                was visible in the area.
                From about 1220 to 1300 Mapungubwe was an advanced trading centre and its inhabitants traded with
                Arabia,
                China and India through the East African harbours. The city could trade because it was so close to
                the
                Limpopo River,
                which connected it with the coast. They exchanged salt, cattle, fish, gold and iron, ivory, wood,
                freshwater snail and mussel shells,
                chert and ostrich. Eggshell beads were used for glass beads and cloth.

                <h3>Makapansgat Caves</h3>
                <img src="Makapansgat.jpg" width="150" style="float: right; padding:10px">

                Makapansgat or Makapan Valley world heritage site has many important archaeological findings dating to
                between 2.6 and 3 million years ago. What is particularly interesting about this site is the famous
                “Makapansgat Pebble”.
                It's suggested to date back to 3 million BCE and is shaped to resemble a human face. It has been
                suggested
                that this pebble
                represents the earliest known example of symbolic thinking of early hominids.The cave is where the clash
                between a Boer Commando
                and local Langa and Kekana people took place, after the murders of Voortrekkers at Moorddrift, Mapela
                and
                Pruizen.
                Chief Makapan (Mokopane), together with a large number of his tribespeople and their cattle were
                besieged in
                the cave for nearly a
                month between 25 October and 21 November 1854, during which time many hundreds died of hunger and
                thirst.
